    <h2>Maker Faire 2025 – Pitching Machine</h2>
    <p>
      For Maker Faire 2025, I designed and built a pitching machine capable of
      consistently launching baseballs using a controlled mechanical system.
      This project required planning, budgeting, testing, and iteration.

    <p>
      The pitching machine was built using readily available materials and
      focused on reliability, safety, and repeatability. The final design
      successfully demonstrated mechanical principles and problem-solving skills.
